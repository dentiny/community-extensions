  extended_description: |
    This extension adds a read cache filesystem to DuckDB, which acts as a wrapper of httpfs extention. 
    It supports a few key features:
    - Supports both metadata cache and data block cache
    - Supports both on-disk cache and in-memory cache, with block size and cache mode tunable
    - Supports disk cache file eviction based on access timestamp
    - Supports parallel IO request, with request size tunable
    - Supports profiling for IO latency and cache hit / miss ratio, which provides an insight on workload characterization
    - Exposes function to get cache size and cleanup cache
    - Provides an option to disable / enable cache, which could act as a drop-in replacement for httpfs
